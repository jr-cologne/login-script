# Login Script

Welcome to this project, a simple database-based login script with PHP.

Before you get started, I would like to give you a few information about it. So please take a minute and read this small documentation carefully.

## Demo Site

You want to see the project in action? Visit the demo site here: http://jr-cologne.16mb.com/login-script/

You can create your own account or just login with the demo account. These are the credentials:

Username: Test, Password: password

Please do not change them!

If you want to do that kind of stuff, create your own account. With that you can do what you want as long as you don't touch anything else then your own account.

## Installation

If you want to run the login script on your local machine or your own server, do the following things.

1. Download the ZIP file of this project.
2. Unzip it and upload the files to your server via ftp or if you want to have it on your local machine, put the files inside your corrensponding directory of your local server. Mostly the directory is called *htdocs*, *www* or something like that.
3. Make sure you have PHP and MySQL or another database installed.
4. Create a new database and then import the table *users*, by the sql file inside the *php* directory, into the database.
5. Open the file *php/config.php* in your editor and change the login settings for your database connection. Also you can make some changes to the other settings, if you want to.
6. Now you should be ready to start!

If you have any trouble installing the login script, find a bug or have a question, open up a Issue and I will try to help you.

Feel free to contribute to this project! Although it is a private project, it would be awesome for me if somebody contributes to it.
